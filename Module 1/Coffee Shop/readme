This time I used both the:
- @Qualifier Annotation
- @ConditionalOnProperty Annotation

Made a Coffee Shop project where there's  two options for coffee (Latte, Espresso),
Used @ConditionalOnProperty Annotation to choose between the two and set the value 
in the application.property file.

For Espresso there's choice between coffee beans (used @Qualifier)

For Latte there are choices in coffee beans, type of milk, type of syrup
Again, used @Qualifier for this.
